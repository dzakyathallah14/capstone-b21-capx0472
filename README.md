## **Background**
In this capstone project, we’re trying to make a pattern matching with face recognition. In case of helping people to make sure that there is no double data when inputting a form, so with face detection on who is filling the form with the inputted form before will be matched or not. Jabar Digital Service has kind of filters to filter which and whom to receive “Bantuan Sosial (Bansos)”, in this case, we add one more filter it is a pattern matching with face recognition based on the characteristics of the individual receivers.
